# HTMLrefactor

## Changes to CSS:
* added comments to describe what the CSS is doing
* consolidated the 9 different classes used for the elements in the right-hand sidebar down to 3 classes, as they were repetitive. I did the same for the repetitive classes for the main content elements. 
* Reordered the CSS file into a more logical order

## Changes to HTML:
* Revised title in head to be more descriptive/meaningful
* Checked links, fixed link to Search Engine Optimization section
* Added alt text to images and icons, including backgrd image
* Updated code to include HTML Semantic elements.
