## Unit 1 Homework 1 HTML Refactor

In the CSS, I:
* added comments
* consolidated the 9 different classes used for the elements in the right-hand sidebar down to 3 classes, as they were repetitive. I did the same for the repetitive classes for the main content elements. 

In the HTML, I:
* Revised the title in the head to be more descriptive/meaningful
* Checked links, fixed link to Search Engine Optimization section
* Added alt text to images and icons, including the large image beneath the header
* Updated using HTML Semantics:
    * updated code in the header to note the navigation by adding  <div id="nav">
    *
